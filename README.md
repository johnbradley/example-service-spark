# Example Binder with Spark
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/binder-project/example-service-spark)

A Binder-compatible repo that uses Spark

This Binder should be built with Spark selected as an optional service. The Spark master will be available within the notebook at `spark://master:7077`, and paths are setup so that `pyspark` can be imported.
